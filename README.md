Assignment 2: <https://github.com/taeeunun00/Assignment_2.git>

-   This repository contains files from the previous assignment and lab exercise. The "Assignment_1.qmd" file is a Quarto template assignment that was due last week. The "Penguin_Exercise.qmd" file is a lab exercise using Quarto to create a website. This file includes practice with adding text, images, and code chunks, as well as exploring the "penguins" dataset with ggplot. Lastly, "Images_for_penguin_exercise" is a folder containing three image files that were used for the Quarto website exercise. The images are organized here to keep the project structure clean!
